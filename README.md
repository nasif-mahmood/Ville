# Ville CS4332 Final Project

Final Project for course CS4332.

VILLE is an adventure game where the protagonist Ville must journey through 3 levels, defeating small slimes and their tough boss. To accomplish this, Ville can swing his trusty sword or fire some fireballs!

Build Instructions:
Make sure you have the forest level or the tutorial level as the active level in the hierarchy before you go to the build window. This will make the lighting work as intended.

Project made in Unity 2020.3.27.
